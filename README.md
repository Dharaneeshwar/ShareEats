# SHARE EATS üçΩÔ∏è  
A platform to bridge the gap between food donors and food needers, making food redistribution efficient and impactful.

> üèÜ **This project was awarded the Best B.Tech Project of the Year!**

## **Overview**  
The concept of food redistribution is active in India, but its execution largely relies on offline communication, limiting its reach and effectiveness. SHARE EATS aims to modernize this process by connecting food donors and needers through a centralized platform.

## **Existing System**  

- Food redistribution in India is mainly offline, making it inefficient and inaccessible for many.  
- In regions like America and Europe, web and mobile applications help streamline food redistribution efforts.  
- However, there is no established platform in India to connect "Food Donors" with "Food Needers."  

## **Proposed System**  
Share Eats offers a solution through:  
1. **A Web Portal**: Stores information about available and needed food, connecting donors and recipients.  
2. **Real-Time Notifications**: Tracks food availability and sends timely alerts for acceptance and delivery arrangements.  

## **Features**  
- Simplified food donation and redistribution process.  
- Efficient communication between food sources and those in need.  
- Real-time tracking and notifications for seamless operations.

## **Tech Stack**  
- **Frontend**: React 
- **Backend Architecture**: FireBase
